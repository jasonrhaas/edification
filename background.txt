You've mentioned several features:

1) Login with username and password
2) Career Profiles (a user page)
3) ability to dialogue (private messaging between users)
4) network (not sure what you mean by embedded profiles and hot connections )
5) (select) ... Is this site invitation only? How do you prevent lousy hiring managers from signing up?

I love that you presented this as a pitch! To help keep things in scope, I would recommend aiming for the first three features (1 - 3 above)

This will still be a good challenge for you, and careful planning will let you use this as the foundation for your new business!

What do you think?

What do you guys think about this for the final project?  Do you think it's doable?

"An online, cloud-based education ecosystem for a global base of paying users. These users will authenticate into the ecosystem via a user name/password and have the ability to dialogue (via an internal secure communication tool in the ecosystem), network (with embedded career profiles and hot connections pages), and learn (via individualized and customized content) with fellow students, professors, administrators, and (select) hiring managers.
 
Our goal is to connect aspirational individuals to relevant course content for career switches, advancement, and training within their current role. Instead of employers paying for training and reading that few employees ever use, we aim to target the employees themselves. By offering low monthly rates and access to current, impactful content, people, and job opportunities, we will bridge the existing gap in the educational market."
